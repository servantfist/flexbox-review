# Flexbox Review

## Description
 This is a somewhat basic app using node and express to be able to
 play with the Flexbox layout properties outside of an application.

 ## App Environment
 - If you are newer to node, I highly recommend using Node Version Manager
  https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm
  https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/node-version-manager-nvm-install-guide/

 - Once you have node and nvm installed, running

    `nvm use`

   will ensure that you are using the proper version of node to play with this
   app. This looks at the version of node in the .nvmrc file an sets the node
   version.

   Note:  It shouldn't be necessary to play with any configurations, as the focus
   is going to be around the index.html and styles.css files, but you may need
   to install the version of node used for this app.  Look at  the nvm help for
   how to do that.

 ## Running the app
- From within the application folder I typically run:
    `SET DEBUG=flexbox-review:* & npm start`

- If you don't want to see the debug (which I recommend if you are playing with
    learning the layout) then simply run:
    `nvm start`
